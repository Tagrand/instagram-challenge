Instagram Challenge
===================


## Scenario <a name= "scenario"></a>

Instagram is meant to be quite good. You get to upload pictures, comment with your friends, and have a great time. ~~But it lacks a competative element, so its no fun really.~~ *Rephrase* Though some may argue that Instagram itself has some underlying competition, there are no formal rules. And as Monica from friends says 'Rules are good, they help control the fun!' An ideology that I also subscribe to. 

So here it is. Pictogram! A combination of Pictionary and Instagram. You upload your pictures (you could hand draw or them or why not try out doing [https://www.draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) for more internet based fun! You upload your pictures, and your friends (or random strangers) guess what you've drawn. 

## Approach <a name= "approach"></a>

I wanted to understand rails more so I started doing a tutorial on how to build Instagram with rails (a funny coincidence). You can see that here[](). The tutorial is excellent and is here[](). I learnt alot from this, about rails and some useful gems, but I didn't want to use it as my actual project and wanted to go totally tutorial free (off the rails...) This product uses some skills I learnt, but requires me to reapply them in new contexts, which will challenge and test my understanding. 

I have set myself 3 targets for this challenge
  
   - Add some cool functionalities that arn't on Instagram - (points for correct guesses, and user rankings) - to challenge my understanding of rails. And beat instagram. 
   - Break jobs down into smaller issues and focusing at passing each at a time
   - Following the pomodoro cycle, to test out if this is a more efficient way of using my time. 
   
As usual I am following TDD, with Capybara and Rspec, but I am going to be focusing on making sure that I don't over test. I sometimes have produced..alot of tests that often overlap or are unclear to users. So I have focused on writing user stories, issues and planning my structure with tests in mind to make sure I produce a throughoutly tested product, that is done so efficiently.
